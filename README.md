SUMMARY:
In this project,an unknown DNA sequence was given and DNA analysis,RNA analysis and protein analysis was done. DNA analysis was done to identify ORFs.RNA analysis was done
to get the predicted secondary structure and to get information related to stability.Protein Analysis was done to see interaction with other proteins.Location of protein was
also found by getting results from more than one tool.Phylogenetic tree was made and evolutionary relationships were interpreted. It was seen that how closely the specieces
are related to each other.Multiple sequence alignment was done.Pathways related to protein were also found.Different funtions of protein were identified.Different tools were used to get
these results.
TOOLS USED:
NCBI, BLASTp,BLASTn,ORF finder, RNAfold,ProtParam, InterPro,PSORT,DeepLoc, Clustal Omega,STRING,SOPMA
